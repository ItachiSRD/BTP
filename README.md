Any shloka in Anushtup chanda is characterized by a total of 32 letters. There are four lines (we call them पाद) and each पाद has exactly eight letters. 
1) In a typical shlok of Anushtup Chanda, the sixth letter of every paad must be GURU.
2) The fifth letter of every paada must be LAGHU
3) The seventh letter of the second and the fourth paada must be HRASVA
4) The seventh letter of the first and third paada must be DEERGHA. [By another definition of Anushtup, Guru is expected here].
